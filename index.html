		<h2>About Spider-Man</h2>
		<p>Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Spider-Man, and other adjectives that former Daily Bugle CEO, J. Jonah. Jameson likes to use. These are only some of many ways to describe Spider-Man, the web-headed *Pun intended* hero of Manhattan. Some say he's a menance, a vigilante, etc. He swings through the city, web to web, to stop crimes and help local New Yorkers feel safer to live in a place they all call home.
